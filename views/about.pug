          p Hey oh! I'm Danny. I have spent the first half of my life following my passion which is music and now for my second and best act, full stack web development. I bring to the table insane organizational skills with wizard-like efficiency. I have a knack for finishing before deadlines and keeping my code on point as much as humanly possible. For a job well done yet fun, go ahead and hire me ;-)
